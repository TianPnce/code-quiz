# Pokemon Knowledge Quiz

## Description
For this assignment we were asked to make a quiz of our choice, so I decided to go back and make a knowledge test from my childhood and that being of course Pokemon. This quiz has a few easy and a few hard questions, and once you are finished you are able to save your score on the leaderboard. This assignment is written in JavaScript and it was very challenging for me because I do have a hard time with it, however through all the trial and error I did learn a lot and now is more easier to understand.

## User Story
```

I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers
```
## Acceptance Criteria
